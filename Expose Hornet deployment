Hornet deployment manifest has 3 replicas with anti pod affinity configured so that these replicas do not get scheduled on same availability zone. This would take care surviving a disaster.

Expose Hornet deployment:
kubectl expose deploy hornet --port=8081
kubectl edit svc hornet // change the type from ClusterIP to LoadBalancer
open 8081 port in the security group of the EC2 instance
Access the Hornet API using the LoadBalancer
